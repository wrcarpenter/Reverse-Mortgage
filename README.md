HECMs are a niche area of the mortgage market. Most people are familiar with single family loans but the concept of a "reverse" mortgage is more unknown. This is partly because it is a financing option only available to older individuals (62+ years) who meet specific eligibility criteria. 

One important feature of HECMs is that they do not have scheduled P/I payments like traditional mortgages. A balance acrrues overtime with interest.
